0.17 20170821
    . Update META.json and META.yml to list the prerequisites.
      This closes RT #122804
    . No module code changes, no need to upgrade

0.16 20170428
    . Modify tests so they work even when the phantomjs executable exists but
      behaves unexpectedly. This is mostly for remote-debugging a CPAN Testers
      failure.
    . No module code changes, no need to upgrade

0.15 20170421
    . Now tested on Linux thanks to Travis CI
    + Use list-open where available to avoid the shell
      This was required to make the module tests work on Travis CI at all
    . Specify CGI.pm as test prerequisite
      This is needed to make the tests work on Perl 5.22+
    . Modify tests so they work with . not being in @INC anymore

0.14 20160924
    . Documentation updates, more links to references
    . Now also tested against PhantomJS 2.1.1 and Selenium::Remote::Driver 1.0

    + Split up command line arguments between PhantomJS and Ghostdriver
      (suggested by K. Klein)
    + The module now uses $ENV{PHANTOMJS_EXE} if it is set
      for finding the executable to launch.     
    + Add cookie_file constructor argument
    + Add ignore_ssl_errors constructor argument
    + Invoke phantomjs with list-pipe-open instead of going through
      the shell, where possible

    . Support for more than one browser instance (dk)

      1.9.2
      1.9.7

0.01 20140323
    . Released unto a propably suspecting audience
    . Most likely, this fails its tests because the appropriate
      phantomjs executable is not found and the proper
      ghostdriver files are not found.

      This will likely be fixed in a later release.
