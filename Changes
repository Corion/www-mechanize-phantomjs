      Submitted by dmuey
    . Documentation fixes by Martin McGrath
    . ->current_form behaves just like WWW::Mechanize::current_form

    . Support for more than one browser instance (dk)

    + Fix breakage introduced by Selenium::Driver::Remote API changes

0.03 20140410
    + Correct the documentation, which was mostly copied from the sister module,
      WWW::Mechanize::Firefox.
    + Fix missing WWW::Mechanize::Link prerequisite
    + Add ->phantomjs_version() to return the version of the PhantomJS executable
    + Place the ghostdriver files along the Perl modules

0.02 20140330
    + ->highlight_node()
    + PhantomJS log level is now customizable
    + Better shutdown behaviour
    + More compatible tests
    + PDF output

    . Tested against PhantomJS versions
      1.9.0, fails t/70-real-status.t
      1.9.2
      1.9.7

0.01 20140323
    . Released unto a propably suspecting audience
    . Most likely, this fails its tests because the appropriate
      phantomjs executable is not found and the proper
      ghostdriver files are not found.

      This will likely be fixed in a later release.
