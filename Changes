    + Add cookie_file constructor argument
    + Add ignore_ssl_errors constructor argument
    + Invoke phantomjs with list-pipe-open instead of going through

0.01 2014-03-23
    . Released unto a propably suspecting audience
    . Most likely, this fails its tests because the appropriate
      phantomjs executable is not found and the proper
      ghostdriver files are not found.

      This will likely be fixed in a later release.
